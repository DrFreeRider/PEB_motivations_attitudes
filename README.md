# What drives households to conform to normative messages? Social norms and water conservation
## Abstract
I examine intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to respond to a normative informational campaign promoting pro-environmental behavior using the a survey of households participants of a randomized experiment. I explore  feelings, attitudes, and behaviors that could explain the response of households exposed directly, through receiveing the message, and indirectly, through others neighbors, to social comparison messages. Findings suggest that anticipated feelings of embarrassment, pride, and a high valuation of injunctive social norms are significant drivers in households indirectly exposed to messages. For those directly exposed, I find no evidence significant channel. The findings suggests that these motivations are established attributes of households and are not impacted by the campaign. Moreover, I find significant differences in self-reported and observed pro-environmental behaviors, contributing to a gap between what people declare and what they do.
